# Math-analysis-Problem
### I decided to experiment on speed of evaluation of sum of infinite series 1/n where n is from 1 to 100 million.
### The minimum result I managed to reach is 2 seconds.
### Multiprocessing library helped me to evaluate sum of infinite series 1/n where n is from 1 to 4B in 107 seconds.
